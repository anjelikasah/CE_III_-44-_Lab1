The above four files contains 2 algorithms: linear search and binary search
Here binary search is sorted search while linear search is for unsorted data
There are two test cases in the files: time.py and unit_test.py
time.py also contains a graphical representation of time vs no. of data in search algorithm

The graph shows that binary search took more time than linear search. This is not because of the searching algorithm. Infact its because of the sorting time required in binary search which is not required in liear search algorithm. Binary search always takes less time than linear search for the larger data; for few data both process nearly at the same time. Algorithm for linear search is easier and simpler.
